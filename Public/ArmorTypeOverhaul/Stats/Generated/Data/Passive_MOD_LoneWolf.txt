new entry "MOD_LONE_WOLF"
type "PassiveData"
data "DisplayName" "Lone Wolf"
data "Description" "At the end of your turn, if no ally is within 8 m, gain +1 to-hit next turn (stacks to +2); resets if you end any turn with an ally within 8 m."
; Implementation plan:
; - In the next step, we'll add logic (via Script Extender) that:
;   (a) checks allies within 8 m at end of your turn,
;   (b) if none -> apply Status 'MOD_LONE_WOLF_BUFF' (add 1 stack, up to 2),
;   (c) if any -> remove all stacks of 'MOD_LONE_WOLF_BUFF'.
; - For now this is a data placeholder so your pipeline recognizes the passive entry.
